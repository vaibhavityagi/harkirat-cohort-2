static website - a website which doesnt change once it has been loaded

3 important things in React
    - components
    - state => anything on the page that changes
    - re-rendering => state change triggers re-render, re-render is the actual dom manipulation which happens due to the state change

anytime a parent re-renders, the child also re-renders

# `npm run build` builds your html css and js, which can run without all the node_modules and other files
