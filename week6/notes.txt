why cant react function return more than one child?
    - reconcilation

- goal should be to minimize the number of re-renders
    - any time a parent re-renders, all the children get re-rendered

- React.memo lets you skip re-rendering a component when the props of that specific component doesn't change

lifecycle of a component
    - initalization
    - mounting
    - updation
    - unmount

- any function starting with 'use' is called a hook
- hooks let you access lifecycle functions

- useMemo lets you remember a value across re-renders

- side effects
